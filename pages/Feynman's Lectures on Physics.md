- Notes from Chapter 1: Atoms in Motion
	- If an apple is magnified to the size of the earth, then the atoms in the apple are approximately the size of the original apple.
	- Jiggling motion of molecules is what we represent as heat.
	- Pressure is how often and how hard particles are hitting something.
		- Thus increasing the density (number of particles) increases the pressure.
	- Total force is pressure x area.
	- "The difference between solids and liquids is, then, that in a solid the atoms are arranged in some kind of an array, called aÂ *crystalline array*, and they do not have a random position at long distances; the position of the atoms on one side of the crystal is determined by that of other atoms millions of atoms away on the other side of the crystal."
