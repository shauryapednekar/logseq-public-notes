- Complex numbers are two dimensional "vectors" where the first dimension is the real number line, and the second dimension is orthogonal to the number line and has the property that a unit in the second dimension squared is equal to negative one on the real number line. Mathematically, $i$ is the unit of the second dimension, and it is defined to have the property that $i^2 = -1$
- Multiplying a complex number $z$ by $i$ rotates Given a complex number $z$, the  result of multiplying it by $i$, $i \cdot z = Rot90(z)$, where the original complex number $z$ is rotated by 90 degrees in the complex number plane.

- What does the complex number plane offer that the "regular" Cartesian/Euclidean plan does not?
	- The complex number plan has a strong notion of multiplication of two complex numbers.
