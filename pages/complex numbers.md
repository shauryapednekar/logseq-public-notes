- Complex numbers are two dimensional "vectors" where the first dimension is the real number line, and the second dimension is orthogonal to the number line and has the property that a unit in the second dimension squared is equal to negative one on the real number line. Mathematically, $i$ is the unit of the second dimension, and it is defined to have the property that $i^2 = -1$
- Multiplying a complex number $z$ by $i$ rotates $z$ by 90 degrees.
	- Mathematically, $z \cdot i. =Rot90(z)$.
	- The intuitive way of thinking about this is that $i$ is the transformation that takes the number 1 to $i$, which preserves magnitude while

- What does the complex number plane offer that the "regular" Cartesian/Euclidean plan does not?
	- The complex number plan has a strong notion of multiplication of two complex numbers.
