- Complex numbers are two dimensional "vectors" where the first dimension is the real number line, and the second dimension is orthogonal to the number line and has the property that a unit in the second dimension squared is equal to negative one on the real number line. Mathematically, $i$ is the unit of the second dimension, and it is defined to have the property thatwe say that $i^2$
