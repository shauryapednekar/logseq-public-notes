	- ```bash
	  sudo groupadd docker
	  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
	  newgrp docker
	  ```
	- Essentially, this creates a new group called `docker` (which probably already exists since it's created during docker installation). It then adds the current user to that group, and
	- This works because communication with the docker unix socket is only allowed by the `root` user and the `docker` group.
