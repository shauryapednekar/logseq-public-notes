	- ```bash
	  sudo groupadd docker
	  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
	  newgrp docker
	  ```
	- Essentially, this creates a new group called `docker` (which probably already exists since it's created during docker installation). `newgrp docker` then temporarily sets the current user's primary group to `docker`, as a way of refreshing the user's group identities without needed to restart the shell.
	- This works because communication with the docker unix socket is only allowed by the `root` user and the `docker` group.
