	- It first gets Nvidia's GPG public key to use for verifying that packages downloaded from its repositories are signed. Next, it adds Nvidia's repositories list to the list of repositories the package mention should look within. It then updates the local package management database with the latest information about packages available in the repositories mentioned in the `.list` files. Next, it installs the ``
