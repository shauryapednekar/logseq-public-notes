- Watched this talk on Netflix's approach to data engineering: {{video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lC0d3gAPXaI}}
	- Notes:
		- The scale of data they were dealing with is massive given Netflix's user base. Many petabytes per day (in 2019).
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Aggressive alerts to detect and reactively fix issues that could degrade performance.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Reduced compute and data duplication by having a single Flink application and configuration driven deployments - a single DAG was created using the configurations stored in S3 (probably something custom since they didn't go into much detail on the DAG creation).
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- The thumbnail is a good high level overview of their architecture.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Fan in/fan out had to be carefully considered when writing transformations.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- They often uncovered bugs in the open source libraries and had to work with them directly to find solutions. This is probably not
