		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Aggressive alerts to detect and reactively fix issues that could degrade performance.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Reduced compute and data duplication by having a single Flink application and configuration driven deployments - a single DAG was created using the configurations stored in S3 (probably something custom since they didn't go into much detail on the DAG creation).
