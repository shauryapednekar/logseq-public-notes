- Python output buffering #gotchas/python
	- Python buffers its output. However, it uses line buffering when both `stdin` and `stdout` are a console, which is why you might not have noticed this before. When we employ file redirection or pipes, Python performs full buffering. See https://www.baeldung.com/linux/python-buffering-and-tee for more.
		- For instance, let's say you have a python script running as a docker container, and you want to see what it's printing out. Simply running `docker logs -f <container-name` will not let you see the output in real time, since the output is being buffered by python before being written to the log file that the docker container tracks. Here are three ways of allowing for real time logs for python applications:
			- Use the `-u` command line switch (i.e. `python3 -u app.py`).
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Set `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` env var to anything other than `0`.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Wrap `sys.stdout` in an object that flushes after every write, or set `flush=True` in the `print()` function.
