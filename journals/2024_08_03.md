- Given how useful I've found [[SQL]], I should learn about [[how sql query engines work]] and the [[math behind sql]].
	- Something about [[linux]].

	- something on the same level
- While working on [[data-engineering personal project]], I spent a good amount of time confused by the `docker logs` output from a python application running inside docker because I had forgotten than python buffers its output. See https://eklitzke.org/stdout-buffering for more. I've only tried the first two options below.
	- Use the `-u` command line switch (i.e. `python3 -u app.py`).
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Set `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` env var
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Wrap `sys.stdout` in an object that flushes after every write
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- `sys.stdout = os.fdopen(sys.stdout.fileno(), 'w', 0)`
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
